# Python 3D renderer
 A 3D objects renderer using Python, Numpy and Pygame that renders any .obj archive.

 Notes:
    *I decided not to fill the polygons that form the object since I would have to use the painter's algorithm, which is not the best option in this case, or the Z-buffer, which, due to processing pixels individually, would end up being too slow for the project.
